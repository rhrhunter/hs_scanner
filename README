Usage:
    ./hs_scanner

It will also display the following in real time:
    1) Your Drawn Cards
    2) Enemy Cards Played
    3) Enemy Secrets

It will keep track of enemy secrets played as well as let you know when they get revealed.

hs_records.log in the current working directory.

The records that are kept include:
    1) Win/Loss Record between your hero against the enemy hero.
    2) Win/Loss Record between you and the opponent overall with your selected hero
    3) Win/Loss Record overall with your selected hero.
